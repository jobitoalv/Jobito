Hi my name is [Job](https://job-alvarez-3dport.netlify.app/)ðŸ‘‹


As a junior developer with experience in HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and React, I'm passionate about building responsive, user-friendly, and scalable applications. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices in software development to expand my skill set.

I take a mobile-first approach to design and enjoy creating intuitive interfaces that enhance user experience. My experience with test-driven development has taught me the importance of writing clean, maintainable code that is easy to debug and extend.

I'm a quick learner and a team player. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with others to achieve project goals. I'm always open to feedback and eager to learn from my peers and mentors.

If you're looking for a junior developer who is passionate about software development, eager to learn, and committed to delivering high-quality applications, I would be excited to contribute to your team.
